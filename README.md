Concept List:
============

Authentication — ensuring someone’s identity (i.e. “we’ve confirmed this user is indeed Jarrod Parkes”)

Authorization — providing someone access to something (i.e. “this user is allowed to post ratings for movies”)

TheMovieDB (TMDB) — the web service we’ll use in this lesson; if you see the abbreviation TMDB, we’re referring to TheMovieDB

HTTP body — part of an HTTP request that allows us to pass parameters without having to pass them in the URL

HTTP POST request — a type of HTTP request where a client submits data to a server for processing

HTTP headers — additional parameters than can be sent in an HTTP request that specify how the request should operate

Authorization flow — a term used to refer to the steps necessary to authenticate and authorize a user

Authorization standards — a commonly used authorization flow; we will not use a specific standard in this course, but we will use a flow that is similar to the authorization standard called OAuth

Domain — (basic definition) what allows a client to find and connect to a server

Subdomain — an extension to a domain that allows a server to organize specific resources together
